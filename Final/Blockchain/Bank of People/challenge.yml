  I actually want to create Bank of Hope, but yeah- People is more fitting.
  Besides, wouldn't you want a Bank that treat you like People?

  PROUDLY PRESENT; THE BANK OF PEOPLE is NOW OPEN!

  NOTE: Due to the low rate of success in the anvil, if your solver
  consecutively failed, please open a ticket providing with your FORGE TEST, EXPLOIT CONTRACT, 
  and STEP TO RUN IT (and ofc, a screenshot that you've actually tried it in your local and 
  solves it). SIA for the inconvenience- :)
