  On August 1st, 2025, a security incident occurred affecting one of the companyâ€™s internal environments. The Incident Response (IR) team conducted an initial assessment and acquired several critical artifacts from the impacted systems.

  The company does not currently employ a Security Operations Center (SOC), so no monitoring alerts or centralized logs were available. However, an internal support ticket was submitted by a member of the development team, reporting unusual behavior on their Windows desktop, the system had become extremely slow, and several important files were no longer accessible due to encryption.

  As part of the Digital Forensics team, you have been assigned to investigate the incident using the artifacts collected by the IR team.

  > Conduct all forensic artifact analysis in a tightly controlled sandboxed environment to isolate potential threats, preserve system integrity, and ensure reliable results.
