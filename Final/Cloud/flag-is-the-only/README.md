# Flag Is the Only Ending for This Challenge

## Description

I've possessed the role of an observer in a cloud-based surveillance system...
...in a CTF challenge, no less.

But of course, the difficulty is hard mode!
No matter what I try, the data slips through my fingers every time.

Before the "real user" logs in and resets everything,
I have to find where the camera's images are sent... and retrieve the flag.

"Let's just cut off the dead ends right away."

A camera that captures everything, then forgets.
A system that smiles politely, but never tells you where it puts things.
Data that flickers into existence... only to vanish moments later.
And somewhere in all this: a flag that was never meant for you.

"I didn't know my role until now.
From now on, I'll stay quiet...
a ghost in the system, unseen and unheard."

...But why does access get easier the more I dig in?

The mad survival story of a CTF player trapped in front of a computer... 
searching for the one ending that matters â€” the flag.
