name: "Flag Is the Only Ending for This Challenge"

description: |-
  I've possessed the role of an observer in a cloud-based surveillance system...
  ...in a CTF challenge, no less.

  But of course, the difficulty is hard mode!
  No matter what I try, the data slips through my fingers every time.

  Before the "real user" logs in and resets everything,
  I have to find where the camera's images are sent... and retrieve the flag.

  "Let's just cut off the dead ends right away."

  A camera that captures everything, then forgets.
  A system that smiles politely, but never tells you where it puts things.
  Data that flickers into existence... only to vanish moments later.
  And somewhere in all this: a flag that was never meant for you.

  "I didn't know my role until now.
  From now on, I'll stay quiet...
  a ghost in the system, unseen and unheard."

  ...But why does access get easier the more I dig in?

  The mad survival story of a CTF player trapped in front of a computer...
  searching for the one ending that matters â€” the flag.
