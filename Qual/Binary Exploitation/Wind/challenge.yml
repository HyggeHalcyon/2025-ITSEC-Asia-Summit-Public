  To access the challenge server, you must submit a support ticket requesting the author to bring the machine online. Once the instance is activated, it will be available for a strict duration of 5 minutes.

  Before activation, the requester must provide a screenshot demonstrating that the exploit was able to get shell access.

  Please note:
  The challenge instance will shut down at 21:00 PM. No further access will be granted beyond this time.
  Be sure to use the available window to take any necessary screenshots promptly for making the writeup.
